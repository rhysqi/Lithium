# Lithium - System Native Text Editor
Lithium is a low-level text editor framework built using System API, designed for fast and efficient text manipulation. Unlike traditional text editors or IDE frameworks, it operates by directly invoking system-level functions, bypassing higher-level libraries or runtimes.
This approach gives developers granular control over text rendering, memory management, and file system interactions, resulting in a highly responsive and optimized experience. With a focus on performance and customization, Lithium aims to provide a "bare-metal" text editing environment, similar to how specialized tools like VSCode are built, but with direct system interaction for enhanced flexibility and speed.
